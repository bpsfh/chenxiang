1. Download all of the files and folders to your server from the github repository, IN your web root. The web root is different on some servers, cPanel it should be public_html/ and on Plesk it should be httpdocs/, and on Apache it should be /var/www/html as default.

    @clone from github
    git clone git@github.com:rontech/opencart.git

2. Rename config-dist.php to config.php and admin/config-dist.php to admin/config.php
